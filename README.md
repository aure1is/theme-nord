# Nord Themes for Uncommon Applications

This repository aims to provide Nord theme configurations for various applications that may not have official Nord theme support, or for which existing themes are not quite right.

The goal is to bring the calm and harmonious arctic-blue aesthetic of Nord to all your digital tools, even the less common ones.

## Contents

This repository will contain subdirectories for each application.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a Nord theme for an application not listed here, or improvements to existing ones, please feel free to open a pull request.
